Github Profile Finder fetches the information from the Github API and displays the profile of the user searched.

I built this project after learning about the APIs, this was a great project which I got to build in which I fetched the user information from the Github API and here I got to implement the Async/Await JS functions. I used the fetch keyword to get the data from the API.
